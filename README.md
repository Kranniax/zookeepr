# Zookeepr

## Description

I created a web server using the Express.js framework and added a front-end application that the local zoo was developing, called Zoo Keepr. The siteâ€™s data will live on the server I built so that anyone can access it without having to download it. I also deployed my application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.

## Requirements
